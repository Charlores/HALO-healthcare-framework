# HALO System Overview

## Purpose
HALO is designed to standardize clinical risk interpretation to improve interoperability,
decision support, and explainability across healthcare systems.

## Core Principles
- Clean data before analysis
- Separate prediction from interpretation
- Standardize meaning before automation
- Keep humans in the loop

## System Layers
1. Data ingestion and cleaning
2. Risk scoring logic
3. Clinical interpretation
4. Standardized interoperability layer

## Why This Matters
Most healthcare failures occur not from lack of data, but from inconsistent interpretation
across systems. HALO addresses this gap.
